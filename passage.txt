Dynamic Memory Allocation: Pointers are essential for dynamically allocating memory in malware. 
This allows malware to allocate memory at runtime for storing payloads, configuration data, or 
encrypted communication channels. Dynamic memory allocation also enables malware to evade static 
analysis by generating code and data structures dynamically.
Function Pointers: Malware may utilize function pointers to implement polymorphic or self-modifying 
code techniques. By dynamically resolving function addresses at runtime, malware can evade 
signature-based detection and hinder reverse engineering efforts. Function pointers can also be
 used for code obfuscation and control flow obfuscation, making 
malware analysis more challenging.
